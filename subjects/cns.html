                        This course provides students an overview of the concepts and fundamentals of
                        computer networks. Internet is a computer network that millions of people use every day. This course
                        examines some of the important concepts related to computer networks like OSI, TCP/IP reference models
                        for networking protocols. Students learn what happens to the data in the computer before it is prepared for
                        transmission, how protocols work to transmit the data and how it is received at other computers. Error
                        control and recovery methods for lost or corrupted data are also investigated. A layered model for computer
                        communications is thoroughly examined. This course is to make the students understand basic concepts in
                        Computer Networks & Security and their mathematical models
